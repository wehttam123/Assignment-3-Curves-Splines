//gl_TessLevelInner and gl_TessLevelOuter
// The inner tessellation level controls the number of “nested” primitives,
// and the outer tessellation level controls the number of times to subdivide each edge.

//Isolines contain no inner value and only two outer values
// outer 0 is how many isolines to draw
// outer 1 is how much to subdivide each line

// gl_in incoming array of structs holding some data coming into the shader
// gl_out outgoing array of structs holding updated data

// gl_PatchVerticesIn is the number of vertices per patch and also the length of gl_in[]

// per vertex out, use "out <type> <name>"
// per patch out, use  "patch out <type> <name>"
